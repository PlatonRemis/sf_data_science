### Description

Write a program that guesses a number from 1 to 100 in as few attempts as possible.

### Quality Metric

The results are evaluated by the average number of attempts at 1000 repetitions. It is necessary to achieve a minimum number of attempts.

### What I practice

* Learn how to write good Python code.
* Learning to work with IDE.
* Learning to work with GitHub.

### Result

My function guesses the number on average in 5.9 attempts.

It also makes no more than 7 attempts.


I enjoyed making a proper python project.

Clean and simple code, coments and PEP8 complient style.

Hope I did a good job.
